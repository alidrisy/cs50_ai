# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my project solutions for [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) course. Each project implements various AI concepts and algorithms covered in the course.

## Project Structure

### Week One
- **Tictactoe**: Implementation of an AI that plays Tic-tac-toe optimally using Minimax algorithm
  - Uses Pygame for visualization
  - Implements adversarial search

### Week Two
- Various AI projects implementing search algorithms and knowledge representation

### Week Three
- **Pagerank**: Implementation of the PageRank algorithm
  - Calculates page importance in web networks
  - Uses both random surfer model and iterative algorithm

## Requirements

To run these projects, you'll need:
```
python 3.x
pygame (for tictactoe and minesweeper games)
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alidrisy/cs50_ai.git
cd cs50_ai
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Navigate to specific project directories to run individual projects. For example:

```bash
cd week_one/tictactoe
python runner.py
```

## Course Progress
